# 🧩 Minesweeper Game

## 📜 Description

Minesweeper Game is a classic puzzle game where the objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them. The game offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. This project demonstrates the use of Python's Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game.
